-- Profile photos. A public bucket, because avatars show on public pages (leaderboard, feed) and a
-- public URL needs no signing. Writes are limited to the member's own folder, `<user id>/...`, so
-- nobody can overwrite or delete someone else's photo. The browser resizes photos before upload,
-- so the 1 MB cap and image-only types are a backstop, not the normal path.
